# ü™ê spaCy Project: Multiannotator Experiments

Experiments on multiple annotators with multi-label/task

## üìã project.yml

The [`project.yml`](project.yml) defines the data assets required by the
project, as well as the available commands and workflows. For details, see the
[spaCy projects documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/projects).

### ‚èØ Commands

The following commands are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run).
Commands are only re-run if their inputs have changed.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `preprocess` | Preprocess raw files to jsonl |
| `partition` | Partition jsonl |
| `convert` | Convert the data to spaCy's binary format |
| `ml-train` | Train the multilabel model |
| `tc-train` | Train the textcat model |
| `evaluate` | Evaluate the model and export metrics |
| `package` | Package the trained model as a pip package |
| `ml-visualize-model` | Visualize the model's output interactively using Streamlit |
| `tc-visualize-model` | Visualize the model's output interactively using Streamlit |

### ‚è≠ Workflows

The following workflows are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run)
and will run the specified commands in order. Commands are only re-run if their
inputs have changed.

| Workflow | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| `preprocess-all` | `preprocess` &rarr; `partition` &rarr; `convert` |
| `train` | `ml-train` &rarr; `tc-train` &rarr; `evaluate` |

### üóÇ Assets

The following assets are defined by the project. They can
be fetched by running [`spacy project assets`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-assets)
in the project directory.

| File | Source | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`assets/multilabel_train.jsonl`](assets/multilabel_train.jsonl) | Local | Clickbait training data for multilabels |
| [`assets/multilabel_dev.jsonl`](assets/multilabel_dev.jsonl) | Local | Clickbait development data for multilabels |
| [`assets/textcat_train.jsonl`](assets/textcat_train.jsonl) | Local | Clickbait training data for textcat (Majority) |
| [`assets/textcat_dev.jsonl`](assets/textcat_dev.jsonl) | Local | Clickbait development data for textcat (Majority) |

### Project overview

This project contains code for running experiments on reframing Webis-16 Clickbait dataset [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3251557.svg)](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3251557) as a multi-label/task problem by annotators consistent with [Davani et al., 2022](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00449/109286/Dealing-with-Disagreements-Looking-Beyond-the).

## Installation

The installation process is automated via `make`.

```bash
# Create virtual environment (optional, recommended)
make create-venv
# Install all dependencies
make install
# Download the zenodo dataset
make download
```

In order for the install to work, you'll need to
add a `.env` file to the root of the project that
contains your Prodigy license key. It should look
something like:

```
PRODIGY_KEY="1234-ABCD-5678-EFGH"
```

## Contents 

The project has a few notable files/folders: 

- The `data/problems` folder contains `.json`, `.html`, and `.jpg` files. This is empty by default but users can run the `make download` to download the files. The data comes in a distributed folder structure where each subfolder is 2,992 tweets. Each subfolder includes the original `.json` file and (optionally) `.html` and `.jpg` file from a link of the tweet.

- Annotation ground truth are provided as `.csv` files in the `data/truth` folder.

## Instances

Here are instances of each file:

```bash

Four examples with a range of annotator agreement out of three annotators from top (100% agree clickbait) to bottom (0% agree clickbait).
